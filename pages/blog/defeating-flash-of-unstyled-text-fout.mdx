I noticed when I loaded my personal site without cache, my text would first display without the correct font. It eventually restyle using the original font after everything loaded.

I was originally using a NPM package called `typeface-roboto` to load my font. This was awesome because I wanted to host the fonts myself instead of pulling from a CDN. I realized the styles included in the package was the reason for my Flash of Unstyled Text (FOUT).

I looked through the code inside the package and checked out the CSS files. Here is an example of how they were adding the font.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Roboto';
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap; /* Line Causing FOUT */
  font-weight: 500;
  src: local('Roboto Medium '), local('Roboto-Medium'), url('/fonts/roboto-latin-500.woff2') format('woff2'), url('/fonts/roboto-latin-500.woff')
      format('woff');
}
```

I noticed the `@font-face` styles were using `font-display: swap;`. When `swap` is set, the browser will give a very short time to load the font before it uses a fallback. Once the font is fully loaded, it will convert back to the expected font. This option is great from a performance standpoint but might affect user experience. If you set `font-display: block`, this will increase the amount of time the browser will have to fetch your fonts before it starts displaying anything on the page. `block` sacrifices performance for user experience.

## My Solution

I pulled all the font files into my project instead of using the NPM package. Then inside my CSS, I loaded the fonts using `font-display: block`;

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Roboto';
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: block; /* No longer causing FOUT */
  font-weight: 500;
  src: local('Roboto Medium '), local('Roboto-Medium'), url('/fonts/roboto-latin-500.woff2') format('woff2'), url('/fonts/roboto-latin-500.woff')
      format('woff');
}
```

Since my websites design is heavily focused on typography. I was willing to sacrifice some performance to give my fonts a little more time to load before anything is displayed.
