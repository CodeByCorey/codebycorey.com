One of the best ways to understand how your blog posts are doing are page views. You can begin to understand what posts and information your readers care more about based on number of views. You can then focus your efforts on the more important content.

Many people use tools like [Google](https://analytics.google.com/) or [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/ref/45XEAJ) Analytics for tracking traffic. With the rise of Ad-Blockers, your traffic collected with these services are not nessarily accurate.

Why not build your own page view tracker using your own API routes. The beauty of using your own API routes, ad-blockers will not risk blocking the request without possibly breaking website functionality. This will allow for a more accurate count of page views.

## Tools Used

### Next.js

We will be using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as our frontend framework. It gives us the power of prerendered React.js, serverless api routes, and typescript with minimal configuration.

### Supabase

[Supabase](https://supabase.io/) is an open-source alternative to firebase. They offer an API wrapped Postgres Database with real-time subscriptions.
